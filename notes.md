# Notes

## Remote Repo
- Copy of project stored in the cloud.
  - This is used to share with others
  - Accessible anywhere there is an internet connection
- Upload all your changes to the server
  - It does not need to be pushed after every single commit
- Branches
  - Branches allow to change fixes and features without breaking the original branch.
  - Master should only contain code that is clean and functional.
  - Git branch <name> will create a new branch
  - Git branch will list all your current branches
  - Git checkout <branch> tells git to change the working branch to the branch name specified

## Additional thoughts


- Scale of 1 to 4
  - On remote repos, I'd say a 4
  - On branches I'd say a 4
  - And on merging I'd also say a 4
  
- Questions I didn't want to say aloud
  - Is it necessary to use seprate branches? Especially when some changes can be considered a fix and a feature
  
- My thanksgiving break
  - Personally, meeting the family of my girlfriend was the best part. This happened on thanksgiving day
